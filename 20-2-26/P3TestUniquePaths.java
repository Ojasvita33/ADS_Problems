// Given a 2D grid of size N x M containing 0s and 1s, write a recursive backtracking algorithm to count the number of unique paths from top-left to bottom-right, such that you can move only right or down and cannot step on a cell containing 1. Provide time complexity analysis and dry run for sample input
